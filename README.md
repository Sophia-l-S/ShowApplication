# ShowApplication
Hello and welcome to my Show Application project.  

This application is for concert lovers and goers to see at a quick glance when and where concerts and shows will be taking place. With this application clients/users can login to the platform and on the home screen, see a schedule of shows that includes the artist, venue, and the date & time. 

If the user wishes to add, update, or delete any of the data they can select the desired tab located at the top of the page. If the user selects the “Shows” tab they will be taken to a page where they can add, update, or delete the artist, venue, or the date & time. They can do this by entering the new information or using the dropdown menu to select already created data. 

If the user selects the “Artist” tab they will be given the option to add, update, or delete an artist. To do this the user can enter in the first and last name of the desired artist, or they can use the dropdown menu to select already created artists. And lastly if the user wishes to add, update, or delete a venue, they can select the “Venue” tab to enter in the name of the venue, the city, and the province or state where the venue is located. 

On each of the tabs, after entering the desired information the user will have the option to cancel or proceed with the changes, and if the user wishes to cancel an extra popup will appear asking the user if they are sure that this is what they want to do. 

A special feature of my application is that on each page a table will be displayed with the show information, containing the artist, venue, as well as the dates & times of all the past shows that have been entered. This way it is easier for the user when entering information to see what shows and information has already been entered.  

Thank you for taking the time to read about my application, I hope you enjoy it and find it useful!
